Think of this as a list of courses and resources to help you learn specific skills to grow as an indie hacker. If I were to ever build a school and teach tangible skills, this is what I'd teach.

## Copywriting

Copywriting is, "effectively figuring out what people want and then using words to get them to do what you want them to do" ([Sam Parr](https://twitter.com/thesamparr/status/1327289025582026753?s=20))

> I've said it 1,000 times: learning copywriting is hands down the most impactful business skill I've ever developed. It helps in business and life ([source](https://twitter.com/thesamparr/status/1136734232510730240?s=20)).
