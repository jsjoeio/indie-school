3. Pick 1 direct mail letter above and package up by hand (write/draw on paper)
4. Reread all the books and newsletters from Step 1 and take hundreds of notes
5. You should've read all those "headline sources" and copied down mucho headlines:
   - [ ] Get back issues of The National Enquirer and copy all the repeated headlines.
   - [ ] Get back issues of Cosmopolitan Magazine and copy all the repeated headlines, especially the "cover blurbs."
   - [ ] Read "2001 Headlines" compiled by Jay Abraham and note down relevant headlines.
6. Take all your notes and headlines, copy them to index cards and put them in a box.
7. Take a break for a few days from all this stuff.
8. Read and reread every ad or direct mail package that has already been written about what you are trying to sell. Take notes on index cards.
9. Take another break. If you have thoughts or ideas, keep them all in your head. Don't let them out... yet.
10. Time to write your ad. Grab all your index cards, shuffle through them. Write down your ideas on more index cards.
11. TODO@jsjoeio - add step 6
